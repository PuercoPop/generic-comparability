GENERIC-COMPARABILITY
===

This is an implementation of CDR-8.

CDR-8 provides an interface for the EQUALS function, which is defined as a general equality predicate, as well as a set of ordering functions for comparison. The semantics are described in the [CDR-8 standard](http://cdr.eurolisp.org/document/8/cleqcmp.html).
